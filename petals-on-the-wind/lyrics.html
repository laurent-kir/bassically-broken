<strong>PETALS ON THE WIND</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Remember how it was first days of spring?
The trees in blossom whispered of the thing
We didn’t know yet what to call.
The garden wall would keep the storm at bay.
I couldn’t even think that it would fall—
So easily one day!

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
There came a wind into our garden;
memories
Turned into scattered reveries
As petals on the wind,
Petals on the wind...
I see them fly away, and I—
I’d catch them, but too late!
If only fate had never intervened...
Petals on the wind...

<strong>THE STORY</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Now that’s a song about a guy who felt alone, who felt outcast. He couldn’t make it with his peers, and he was misbehavior-prone in his teen years, to get attention; so oftentimes he would end up—well—in detention. He didn’t care.

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
I don’t care! It will pass!
And there’ll start another chapter of my life.
It’s not fair, but it won’t last:
There will come a new beginning, and I’ll dive
In! I’ll dive in!

<strong>COMPLICATED</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Hey, do you know how bad it gets
When I’m awake at night
And cannot fall asleep?
It’s building up inside,
This urge to be with you;
I’m reaching for a smoke
To choose another drug:
The lesser of the two.

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
It’s complicated!
This knot I cannot disentangle.
I’m suffocating!
This love will strangle,
This love will strangle me!

<strong>MESS</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
It’s pouring rain outside, and it’s pouring rain in my heart. I know I’m a mess, but I can’t help it. Would you blame me for how I am? I’ve never wanted for any of this to happen; things just got out of control. I tried, oh boy, did I try, but I guess one simply cannot tell their heart what to feel.

<strong>WITHDRAWAL</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Hurting deep inside (this pain, still keen),
I hold on to my memories of you,
Of you and me. I smell of nicotine,
A little drunk, I’m calling you again,
But can’t get through.

<span class="metatext">[Pre-chorus]</span>
Just tell me when, please tell me when
This will be over.

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
Oh how much longer? I’m addicted, I’m—
I’m burning from this love withdrawal.
I think of you, I need you all the time—
I wonder if you think of me at all.

<strong>FORGET</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Another evening spent rememb’ring what is better to forget... October, with its colors yellow-red, reminds you of the days you shared with her abroad, away from home. She opened up her heart, a bit naive...

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
Just let it go, kid! Leave it behind!
And live on as if you two have never met.
Forget, forget, forget...

<strong>AT SUNSET</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
The sun was going down, and I
Was thinking, “Why?” as I went down—
Down mem’ry lane; and passers-by
Were fading... Fading, too, was town.

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
Torn—I was torn asunder.
Burn—I was burning either end.
Hurt, I was going under.
Heart, do you still pretend?

<strong>OVER</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Do you remember talks we used to have: the universe, same worlds? (Especially that part.) It’s getting worse, and my reality is crumbling down now that we’ve gone apart. I think of—well—of quantum immortality, scientific paradigms. If that be true, I may have died a countless lot of times—from losing you.

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
Losing you—
It hurts so bad inside.
My heart’s a bursting supernova.
It’s die or start anew:
It’s quantum suicide...
So is it over?

<strong>GOODBYE</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Watching myself in the mirror
(Who is that looking at me?),
I can see there a ghost, a chimera
Of a life that was not meant to be.
And I’m helplessly drawn to that vision;
Looking-glass, let me in, let me through!
Deep incision...
Shattered glass... You...

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
You!
This was long overdue, but at last
I am saying adieu to the past,
To you,
To you...

<strong>COMPLICATED (CLUB REMIX)</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Hey, do you know how bad it gets
When I’m awake at night
And cannot fall asleep?
It’s building up inside,
This urge to be with you;

To choose another drug:
The lesser of the two.

It’s complicated!
This knot I cannot disentangle.
I’m suffocating!
This love will strangle,
This love will strangle me!

<strong>GOODBYE (METALCORE VERSION)</strong>

<span class="metatext">[Verse 1]</span>
Watching myself in the mirror
(Who is that looking at me?),
I can see there a ghost, a chimera
Of a life that was not meant to be.
And I’m helplessly drawn to that vision;

Deep incision...
Shattered glass... You...

<span class="metatext">[Chorus]</span>
You!
This was long overdue, but at last
I am saying adieu to the past,
To you,
